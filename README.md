Textile Defect Detection Using Transfer Learning

# Textile Defect Detection Using Transfer Learning

This repository contains the implementation of a textile defect detection system using modern deep learning and transfer learning techniques.  
The goal of the project is to classify fabric images into **good** or **damaged**, enabling automated inspection in textile manufacturing.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Textile quality inspection is a crucial step in garment manufacturing. Manual inspection is costly, slow, and error-prone.  
In this project, we leverage **transfer learning** with three pretrained convolutional neural networks:

- **VGG-16**
- **Inception V3**
- **DenseNet-121**

We modify the classification heads and fine-tune the final block of each network to adapt them to the textile defect domain.

Ablation experiments were also performed to study the effect of unfreezing higher-level layers and their impact on model performance.
